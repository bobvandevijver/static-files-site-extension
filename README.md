# Enable Web fonts for Azure App service

By default files with .woff2, .woff and .tff extensions are not served by IIS in Azure App service. This extension simply add MIME types for these font files.

This will work with:

Font Awesome
Simple Line Icons
IconMoon 
And any more static .woff2, .woff and .tff files in your project
